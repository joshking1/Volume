# Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.

# You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.

# Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.

# Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.

# Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt the contents of volumes, or to add other functionality.
